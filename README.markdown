CakePHP Combinator Plugin
=========================

A CakePHP Combinator plugin for CakePHP 2.1 - combine, minify and cache Javascript and CSS files for faster load times.

This plugin basically takes the [2010 Combinator Article from the Bakery](http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/st3ph/2010/09/10/combinator-compress-and-combine-your-js-and-css-files), makes it compatible with CakePHP 2.1, and packages it as a plugin, including CSSTidy and jsmin.

Please Note - this is my first CakePHP plugin, and also my first public GitHub project. As far as I know the code included is all legit and open source. Let me know if not.
